      <p align="justify"><em>Hey Everyone!</em>
      Hope best for you all. From the title you can guess I am going to talk about stitching methods. Most of us have picture of our grandmother in our mind who keeps knitting sweaters and winter scarfs, even I did until I started learning from YouTube on my own. Now a days crochet and knitting are I would say the new trend. My friends and even my husband usually pick me regarding my passion for crochet. But there is so much more apart from sweaters and mufflers. My grandmother is an expert crocheter. She is self-taught, she learned during the time when everything was not on our tips via Internet and YouTube like nowdays. <br><br>Learning has become so much easier with Internet. My mom used to tell me how hard it was in olden times to learn a new pattern because if you see it somewhere and ask for the pattern method, people would resist giving you any information. </p>

         <p align="justify"><br>The picture shows granny squares crocheted out of maroon and multicolor yarn. These are widely used with multiple pattern changes by artists. These can be joined together and be turned into different clothing items like shawl, sweater, cardigan, mufflers and even bags. Crocheting is trending hobby which has made its own place in fashion world. It's kind of addictive as you cannot stop in between a stitch and it keeps you going until you hands are stiff. HEHE!

        <p><br><br>I feel embroidery is older than crochet, it may not be true but I just think crochet is evergreen and will always be young. No offense to Embroidery lovers. There was atime when I was amazed at this art and would give so much time to it.</p>
